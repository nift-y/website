            <h1>Our mission</h1>
            <p>ASL Junction strives to connect family and friends inside and out of 
                the ASL Community.  We desire to create and support an integrated
                community of signers for those we love.  We encourage communication
                through sharing educational and social activities, in and out of the
                deaf community.
            </p>

            <h1>Language First</h1>
            <p>90% of children who are deaf are raised by hearing parents. Less than 
                40% of families with school aged deaf children use sign language at 
                home according to a study from Gallaudet University.
            </p>
            
            <h1>Community</h1>
            <p>As parents we have seen our deaf children isolated in hearing communities, 
                and we have rejoiced when a child took time to learn to learn a sign. We 
                are here to broaden playground signers. 
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>We share ASL to everyone - for their first or second language. </p>
